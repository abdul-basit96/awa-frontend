                    George Land & Beth Jarman's landmark NASA study identified that kids
                    
                    peak in creativity at age 6, followed by a gradual decline as they
                    
                    grow up.

                    The real promise of coding is not that kids will become computer engineers.
                    
                    Coding is a fun tool for kids to exercise their desire to build,
                    
                    curiosity to question, imagination to explore - the traits that will serve
                    
                    any child  well in nearly any career, in every hobby, and in life.
